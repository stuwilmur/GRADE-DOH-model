This package implements the core economic model only; it must be provided with input data.

## Model

The Government Revenue and Determinants of Health model (GRADE) provides a precise and realistic model of the relationship between government revenue and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The GRADE Model translates the impact of additional revenue into potential SDG progress – for example, to quantify the POSITIVE impact of a large taxpayer or the NEGATIVE impact of tax abuse.

See the [API documentation](./API.md).

## Testing

This repository includes a suite of unit tests created using Jest;  run the tests using `npm test`. Coverage results are reported above.

Several tests refer to various validation spreadsheets, which are to be found in [test/assets](./test/assets).

## Data

Suitable data is provided by the [GRADE-DOH-data package](https://github.com/stuwilmur/GRADE-DOH-data).
